# TODO

- [x] Create project scaffold, including `README`, `src`, agent folder, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`
- [x] Create initial `TODO`
- [x] Create `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Create `.env` and point to a Google Cloud project
- [x] Create environment setup script
- [x] Create `Makefile`
- [x] Create `GEMINI.md`
- [x] Create configuration and logging modules
- [x] Create Coordinator Agent
- [x] Create Discover Files tool
- [x] Create File Reader Agent and file read tool
- [x] Create Content Summariser Agent
- [x] Create initial unit tests
- [x] Create experimentation Jupyter notebook
- [x] Parameterise number of files to process
- [x] Implement pydantic to enforce output schema
- [x] Add callback to ensure doc summariser agent creates output in the correct JSON format.
- [x] Add sequential agent such that all files are read first, and then all content is summarised second.
- [x] Add callback to capture the output of read files and store in session state.
- [x] Complete project summarisation step.
- [x] Eliminate 429/quote issues when calling Gemini, particularly from `document_summariser_agent`
- [x] Fewer sections, controlled by folder depth.
- [x] Complete final `llms.txt` file creation.
- [x] Provide a client way to run the application without having to send a prompt, e.g. using CLI arguments.
- [x] Replace LangChain File Read tool with custom tool; eliminate need for callback.
- [x] Make repo public.
- [x] Write blog.
- [x] Add Gemini CLI GitHub workflows.
- [x] Don't assume remote GitHub repo path matches local path.
- [x] Perform project review.
- [x] Increase test coverage by adding unit tests for the agents and other utility functions.
- [x] Make sure it can work with remote GitHub repos as well as local.
- [x] To avoid exceeding the context window, we should split the input into batches and iterate,
      possibly using the [loop pattern](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/choose-design-pattern-agentic-ai-system#loop-pattern)
- [ ] Introduce a quality checker to fill in any missing summaries.
- [ ] Add integration tests to test the end-to-end functionality of the agent.
- [x] Make the list of excluded directories in `discover_files` configurable, in a deterministic way.
- [x] Exclude also based on .gitignore.
- [ ] Consider using ADK artifacts rather than storing file contents in session state. See [ADK Artififacts](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/artifacts/)
- [ ] Allow configurable section depth when creating the `llms.txt`, using `.env` and `Config`
- [ ] Introduce agent evaluation
